# Assignment 2 - Industry Talk 1 (PPG) Poster

## 💡 Reflection
The industry talk 1 by PPG provided me with valuable exposure to how Technology and Information System (TIS) are applied in real industrial environments. Through this assignment, I learned how PPG integrates Data Analytics, Global IT Infrastucture and SAP Enterprise Systems to support business operations, decision-making and sustainability goals. By designing the poster, I better understood how these three components work together rather than functioning independently.

From this industry talk, I gained a clearer understanding of the gap between theoretical knowledge that learned in university and real world practices. I also learned that skills such as Python, SQL, data visualization tools and SAP systems are highly relevant and demanded in the industry. This strengthened my awareness of how TIS plays a crucial role in supporting business efficiency, competitiveness and digital transformation. Overall, this assignment motivated me to improve my technical and analytical skills, especially in data analytics and enterprise systems as they are essential for future career readiness.
